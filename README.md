# Search-Based Software Engineering Course WS23/24


This repository contains the code examples and content of the lectures. I
will be uploading rendered versions as PDF files to StudIP, and include
rendered Markdown versions in this repository. If you want to run the
notebooks yourself, you will need to install [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install).
If you need help with setting up Jupyter, here's a tutorial on [how to install jupyter notebook on your machine](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/).


## Chapter 1: Random and Local Search

The first chapter covers the coding examples from the first two weeks, on basic random search and local search algorithms.

## Chapter 3: Evolutionary Search (Part 2)

This chapter looks into the various search operators of a genetic algorithm:
Survivor selection, parent selection, crossover, mutation, and the
population itself.

## Chapter 4: Multi-Objective Optimisation (Part 1)

This chapter covers the basics of Pareto optimality, NSGA-II, and comparison
of multi-objective search algorithms.

## Chapter 5: Multi-Objective Optimisation (Part 2)

This chapter covers several alternative multi-objective search algorithms:
A random baseline, PAES, SPEA2, TwoArchives, and SMS-EMOA.

## Chapter 6: Search-based Test Generation (Part 1)

This chapter looks at how the problem of test input generation can be cast
as a search problem, and how to automatically instrument programs for
fitness generation.

## Chapter 7: Search-based Test Generation (Part 2)

This chapter continues whole test suite generation, and then moves on to
many objective optimisation for test generation.

## Chapter 8: Genetic Programming

This chapter introduces classic genetic programming for scenarios assuming
type closure, and applies this to symbolic regression and spectrum-based
fault localisation. It also looks at grammatical evolution and automated program repair.

## Chapter 9: Neuroevolution

This chapter introduces the field of Neuroevolution in which evolutionary algorithms are used to optimise artificial
neural networks. We start with the definition of neural networks and the pole balancing problem, a popular reinforcement
learning task which will be solved using two different Neuroevolution algorithms. The two algorithms, Symbiotic Adaptive
Neuroevolution (SANE) and Cooperative Synapse Neuroevolution (CoSyNE), respectively, evolve a population of hidden
neurons and connection weights.
