# Search-Based Software Engineering Course WS23/24


This repository contains the code examples and content of the lectures. I
will be uploading rendered versions as PDF files to StudIP, and include
rendered Markdown versions in this repository. If you want to run the
notebooks yourself, you will need to install [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install).
If you need help with setting up Jupyter, here's a tutorial on [how to install jupyter notebook on your machine](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/).


## Chapter 1: Random and Local Search

The first chapter covers the coding examples from the first two weeks, on basic random search and local search algorithms.

## Chapter 3: Evolutionary Search (Part 2)

This chapter looks into the various search operators of a genetic algorithm:
Survivor selection, parent selection, crossover, mutation, and the
population itself.
